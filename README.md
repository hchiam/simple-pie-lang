# "Simpler" PIE

An amateur linguistics attempt at a simpler-to-approach version of the [Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).

This is just a project for fun, and for [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) purposes tries to make [simplifying assumptions that may not be totally accurate, like how to simplify *h1 *h2 \*h3](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/9541/spelling-of-laryngeals-in-proto-indo-european/28186#28186) in the [phonology of PIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language#Phonology). The words generated by the code assume you're familiar with the so-called [laryngeal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_theory#Pronunciation).
